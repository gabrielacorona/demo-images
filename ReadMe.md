# Passing images through fetch call Demo

- - - 
This repo is dedicated to demonstrate how to:
* pass images through a fetch call  
* add the images to a database 
* display images from the db in the frontend

ps: this method can also work for file passing but it has been configured to only accept jpeg and png type files

This tutorial is based on this video:

NOTE: the technique from the video doesn't work for frontend
it's better to use upload.any()
